Command lines for building the daemon in interesting ways.

--

Build with optimizations:

$ scons EXTRA_CFLAGS='-O2'

--

Build with clang instead of GCC:

$ scons CC=clang LD=clang

--

Build with clang, and run in TSan mode (i.e., enable the thread sanitizer,
which helps detect race conditions); requires a recent clang (v3.3 works):

$ scons CC=clang LD=clang EXTRA_CFLAGS='-fsanitize=thread -O1' EXTRA_LDFLAGS='-fsanitize=thread'

--

Equivalently for memory sanitizer:

$ scons CC=clang LD=clang EXTRA_CFLAGS='-fsanitize=address -O1' EXTRA_LDFLAGS='-fsanitize=address'
